base files til galleri opgaven.

Se funktion [her] ( https://bo-nicolaisen.github.io/animal-gallery/ )

The code of this functional page can be downloaded from https://github.com/bo-nicolaisen/animal-gallery
This code includes a loading animation (also called preloader, or loading indicator).
There are sites where one can download preloaders for free, for instance: 
https://lottiefiles.com/free-animations/?type=free
https://loading.io
I also encountered the word "spinner," but it must designate circular preloaders and exclude progress bars...
